<h3>My Work History</h3>
<p>
	I graduated with a degree in psychology/sociology.  I decided I didn't want to work in either field, so I got my MCSE.  I worked as a systems administrator, mostly on Exchange servers.  After my oldest daughter was born, I decided to stay home with her.  A few years ago, I began selling some of my crafts.  Shortly after that, I also started working with a woman who owns a t-shirt quilt business.  Now I'm starting coding, and I'll go from there!</p>

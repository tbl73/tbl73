		<p>Future Problem Spolvers (FPS) is a set of competitions involving thinking futuristically.  Global Issues Problem Solving is a competition in which a team of students use a six step problem solving process to analyze a scenario set in the future.  They have to follow a very specific format in their writing. They research the topic in advance and should include information from their research in their booklet. 
		</p>
		<h2>The 6 Steps</h2>
		<ol class="colors">
			<li>Challenges: identify up to 16 challenges in the future scene</li>
			<li>Underlying Problem: determine which challenge you consider the most important</li>
			<li>Solutions: invent up to 16 solutions to the underlying problem, using futuristic thinking</li>
			<li>Criteria: write five criteria by which your solutions should be analyzed</li>
			<li>Criteria (pt 2): Analyze each solution using the criteria, to determine the best solution for your underlying problem</li>
			<li>Action Plan: write a persuasive essay about why your winning solution is the best, making sure to flesh out your solution in the process</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In addition, students must perform a skit demonstrating their action plan.  This skit is required, though the points from the skit don't apply to overall scores.</p>
		<p>The other types of competition involved in FPS are Community Problem Solving, Scenario Writing, and Scenario Performance.  Community Problem Solving is an activity in which students identify a problem in their community and work on a plan to help with that problem.  Scenario Writing is basically futuristic creative writing on a specific, researched topic.  Scenario Performance is similar to Scenario Writing, but the story is performed orally.</p>
